# MyReads

MyReads is an app that lets you search for books and categorize them in certain shelves. The main page shows your current books in one of the following shelves: "Currently reading", "Want to read", "Read". The arrow on each book opens a menu that lets you move a book between shelves or delete it from your list. 

To search for books, click on the plus sign on the lower right of the app. Enter the search query in the input line on the top. The shown books can be handled in the same way as the books on the regular shelves. Keep in mind, that only certain search terms are applicable. A full list can be seen in the file "SEARCH_TERMS.md".

Happy reading!
